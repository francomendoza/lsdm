This is an experimental UI for lab notebooking, where data collection is needs
a flexible schema.

Templates serve as schemas for a node in a graph. You can generate a node (or template instance)
from any template. As you are creating a new Template instance, you can connect it to either exisitng nodes/instances or create new ones. You should be able to easily traverse the graph forward and
backward as you're working.

TODOs:

[x] Add a search page for all available templates
[] Add navigation between templates including removing breadcrumbs when navigating
away from page
[] Add ability to customize template by adding more properties and related nodes
[] Add some sort of dropbox paper functionality where you can change order of
properties and related nodes, add notes in between
[] Add colloborator functionality, so see what other users are currently editing
[] Add deep linking for property values to refer to property values on other nodes
[] On creation of related node, remove the option to create again, instead add a
placeholder with some data, and ability to 'x' it out
[x] Persist created TemplateInstances to localstorage to avoid refresh errors
[] Fix bug where navigation disappears after refresh

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
